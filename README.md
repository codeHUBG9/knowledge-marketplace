### Prerequisites
- Node.js v22.11.0 or higher
- MongoDB v8.0+
- Redis v7.0+
- Docker and Docker Compose (optional)
- Git

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone and Configure Repository**:
   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/codeHUBG9/knowledge-marketplace.git
   cd knowledge-marketplace

   # Copy environment files
   cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env
   cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env
   ```

2. **Backend Setup**:
   ```bash
   # Install API dependencies
   cd apps/api
   yarn install

   # Configure environment variables
   # Edit .env file with your local settings:
   # - MongoDB connection string
   # - JWT secret
   # - Redis configuration
   # - Other API keys

   # Start the development server
   yarn dev
   ```

3. **Frontend Setup**:
   ```bash
